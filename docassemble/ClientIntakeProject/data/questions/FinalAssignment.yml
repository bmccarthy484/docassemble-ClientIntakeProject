  Part 4 of 4: Information About Pre-Funding of the Life Insurance Premiums Included in this Program
field: part_four

question: |
  Special Pre-Funding Arrangements – Will the SERP life insurance policy premiums be pre-funded in any way? 
subquestion: |
  If so, depending on the details of those arrangements, additional documents and related fees may apply.
fields:
  - "Check those boxes below that apply:": special_type
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - Policy Premiums will be pre-funded by an annuity or other investment owned by the Employer.   In this case, no special legal work is required in documenting the SERP. 
      - Policy Premiums will be pre-funded by a lump sum deposit of cash advanced by the Employer into a separate account owned with a third party (including the insurer).  In this case, special legal work may be required to ensure that the Employer has a properly documented lien or other possessory interest on the separate pre-funding cash account.  Sherin and Lodgen LLP will charge an additional flat fee of $1,000 to document such a cash pre-funded SERP, unless the Employer/other Employer attorney documents those collateral arrangements itself.
      - There are other arrangements, not described above, to pre-fund the SERP(s).  Sherin and Lodgen LLP will consult with the Employer to determine if it will be expected to provide services related to such special arrangements, and charge a separate fee for those special services based on the time required to do that special work.
