IV\. [INFORMATION ABOUT PRERFUNDING OF THE LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS
INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM]{.underline}:

> Special Pre-Funding Arrangements -- Will the SERP life insurance
> policy premiums be pre-funded in any way?  If so, depending on the
> details of those arrangements, additional documents and related fees
> may apply. Check those boxes below that apply:
>
> \_\_\_  Policy Premiums will be pre-funded by an annuity or other
> investment owned by the Employer.   In this case, no special legal
> work is required in documenting the SERP. 

 

> \_\_\_ Policy Premiums will be pre-funded by a lump sum deposit of
> cash advanced by the Employer into ***a separate account owned with a
> third party (including the insurer)***.  In this case, special legal
> work may be required to ensure that the Employer has a properly
> documented lien or other possessory interest on the separate
> pre-funding cash account.  Sherin and Lodgen LLP will charge an
> additional flat fee of $1,000 to document such a cash pre-funded
> SERP, unless the Employer/other Employer attorney documents those
> collateral arrangements itself.

 

> \_\_\_ There are other arrangements, not described above, to pre-fund
> the SERP(s).  Sherin and Lodgen LLP will consult with the Employer to
> determine if it will be expected to provide services related to such
> special arrangements, and charge a separate fee for those special
> services based on the time required to do that special work.
